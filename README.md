<h1>Azure - SIEM Setup</h1>

 <h2>Description</h2>
Cybersecurity Project: Azure VM and Microsoft Sentinel Integration

- Deployed a Virtual Machine (VM) on Microsoft Azure with an intentionally open RDP port (3389) to simulate a vulnerable environment for testing and monitoring.
- Connected the VM to Azure Log Analytics to capture and analyze event logs in real-time.
- Integrated the log data with Microsoft Sentinel using a data connector for centralized security monitoring and threat detection.
- Configured Sentinel rules to generate security alerts for successful sign-ins, enhancing the detection of unauthorized access attempts.
- Gained hands-on experience with cloud-based security tools, log management, and threat detection in a real-world scenario.
<br />


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- Azure Virtual Machines (VMs): For hosting the virtual machine where you left the RDP port open for testing.
- Azure Log Analytics: For collecting and analyzing logs from the VM.
- Microsoft Sentinel: A SIEM tool for monitoring, threat detection, and alerting based on the logs from your VM.
- Azure Portal: For configuring and managing the VM, Log Analytics, and Sentinel integration.
